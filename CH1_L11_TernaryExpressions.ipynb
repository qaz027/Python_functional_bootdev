    "Ternary Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ternaries are a great way to reduce a series of statements, like an if/else block, to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first learned how to use conditional logic in Python, it probably looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    result = number / 2\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    result = (number * 3) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This code sets result to a dummy value like 0 (None would also work), then overwrites it with its \"real\" value based on the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ternary lets us do all that in one expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "result = number / 2 if number % 2 == 0 else (number * 3) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we also avoided mutating the result variable. Ternary expressions are good for maintaining immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a ternary in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "value_a if condition else value_b\n",
    "\n",
    "This qualifies as an expression because it's a single statement that evaluates to a value – one of two values, depending on the condition.\n",
    "When to Use Ternaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Ternary expressions are cool, but don't overdo it. If you're dealing with complex conditional logic, it's often easier to work with full if/else blocks than to try to nest ternaries inside each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "    \"Access granted\"\n",
    "    if (\n",
    "        user.is_authenticated\n",
    "        and (user.role == \"admin\" or (user.role == \"editor\" and not user.suspended))\n",

    "    else (\"Access limited\" if user.is_authenticated else \"Access denied\")\n",
