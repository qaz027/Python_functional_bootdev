    "# No-Op\n",
    "\n",
    "A [no-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_\\(code\\)) is an operation that does... nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function doesn't return anything, it's probably impure. If it doesn't return anything, the only reason for it to exist is to perform a side effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example No-Op\n",
    "\n",
    "This function performs a useless computation because it doesn't return anything or perform a side effect. It's a no-op.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    x * x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Side Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "This function performs a side effect. It changes the value of the `y` variable that is outside of its scope. It's impure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "y = 5\n",
    "def add_to_y(x):\n",
    "    global y\n",
    "    y += x\n",
    "\n",
    "add_to_y(3)\n",
    "# y = 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) keyword just tells Python to allow modification of the outer-scoped `y` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## print()\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the `print` function (technically) has an impure side effect! It doesn't return anything, but it does print text to the console, which is a form of I/O.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Fix the `remove_emphasis` function by making it pure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "`remove_emphasis` takes a document with any number of lines and removes any number of `*` characters that are at the start or end of a word. (In case you need it, here's a primer on [emphasis in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis).)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I *love* Markdown.\n",
    "I **really love** Markdown.\n",
    "I ***really really love*** Markdown.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Should become:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I love Markdown.\n",
    "I really love Markdown.\n",
    "I really really love Markdown.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that `remove_emphasis` is currently impure – it modifies a global variable called `doc`. It should instead accept a document as an _argument_ and return a _new document_ with emphasis removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've purified `remove_emphasis`, you can also delete the global `doc` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in this assignment use some Python built-ins that are definitely worth knowing, including [`str.split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split), [`str.strip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip), [`map`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map), and [`join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join).\n"
