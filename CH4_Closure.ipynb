    "# Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "A [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_\\(computer_programming\\)) is a function that references variables from outside its own function body. The function definition _and its environment_ are bundled together into a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a closure is just a function that **keeps track of some values** from the place where it was _defined_, no matter where it is executed later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The `concatter()` function returns a function called `doc_builder` (yay higher-order functions!) that has a reference to an _enclosed_ `doc` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def concatter():\n",
    "\tdoc = \"\"\n",
    "\tdef doc_builder(word):\n",
    "\t\t# \"nonlocal\" tells Python to use the 'doc'\n",
    "\t\t# variable from the enclosing scope\n",
    "\t\tnonlocal doc\n",
    "\t\tdoc += word + \" \"\n",
    "\t\treturn doc\n",
    "\treturn doc_builder\n",
    "\n",
    "# save the returned 'doc_builder' function\n",
    "# to the new function 'harry_potter_aggregator'\n",
    "harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()\n",
    "harry_potter_aggregator(\"Mr.\")\n",
    "harry_potter_aggregator(\"and\")\n",
    "harry_potter_aggregator(\"Mrs.\")\n",

    "print(harry_potter_aggregator(\"Drive\"))\n",
    "# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `concatter()` is called, it creates a new \"stateful\" function that _remembers_ the value of its internal `doc` variable. Each successive call to `harry_potter_aggregator` appends to that same `doc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## nonlocal\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a keyword called [nonlocal](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) that's required to modify a variable from an enclosing scope. Most programming languages don't require this keyword, but Python does.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Doc keeps track of how many words are in a collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [ ] Complete the `word_count_aggregator` function.\n",
    "    1. [ ] It should return a function that calculates the number of words in its input (`doc`, a string).\n",
    "    2. [ ] It should then add that number to an _enclosed_ `count` value and return the new `count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it keeps a running total of the `count` variable within a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def word_count_aggregator():\n",
    "    word_count = 0\n",
    "    def count_words(doc):\n",
    "        nonlocal word_count\n",
