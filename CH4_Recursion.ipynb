    "# Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "[Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_\\(computer_science\\)) is a famously tricky concept to grasp, but it's honestly quite simple - don't let it intimidate you! A recursive function is just a function that calls itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Example of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "If you thought loops were the only way to iterate over a list, you were wrong! Recursion is fundamental to functional programming because it's how we iterate over lists while avoiding stateful loops. Take a look at this function that sums the numbers in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def sum_nums(nums):\n",
    "    if len(nums) == 0:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    return nums[0] + sum_nums(nums[1:])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n",
    "# 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't break your brain on the example above! Let's break it down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Solve a Small Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to sum all the numbers in a list, but we're not allowed to loop. So, we start by solving the smallest possible problem: summing the first number in the list with the rest of the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "return nums[0] + sum_nums(nums[1:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Recurse\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what actually happens when we call `sum_nums(nums[1:])`? Well, we're just calling `sum_nums` with a smaller list! In the first call, the `nums` input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, but in the next call it's just `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. We just keep calling `sum_nums` with smaller and smaller lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Base Case\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when we get to the \"end\"? `sum_nums(nums[1:])` is called, but `nums[1:]` is an empty list because we ran out of numbers. We need to write a base case to stop the madness.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if len(nums) == 0:\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"base case\" of a recursive function is the part of the function that does _not_ call itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Doc can automatically generate various layouts for a page. There are a _lot_ of possible layouts, so we need a [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) function to calculate the total number of possible layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the `factorial_r` function. It should recursively calculate the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a number. For example, `5!` (read: \"five factorial\") is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`, which is `120`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What's a small problem you can solve first?\n",
    "2. How can you go from the \"first\" value of `x` to the \"next\" value of `x`, all the way down to the \"last\" value of `x`?\n",
    "3. What's the base case that should stop the recursion?\n",
    "4. Since `0!` is an [empty product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_product), what should an input of `0` return?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial_r(x):\n",
    "    if x == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
