    "Map\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Map\", \"filter\", and \"reduce\" are three commonly used higher-order functions in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the built-in map function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) as inputs. It returns an iterator that applies the function to every item, yielding the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](ch2_L5_mapImage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With map, we can operate on lists without using loops and nasty stateful variables. For example, given this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_nums = []\n",
    "for num in nums:\n",
    "    num_squared = square(num)\n",
    "    squared_nums.append(num_squared)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(squared_nums)\n",
    "# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use map instead, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_nums = map(square, nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list(squared_nums))\n",
    "# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "map() returns a \"map object\", so the list() type constructor is needed to convert it back into a standard list.\n",

    "\n",
    "Markdown supports two different styles of bullet points, - and *. We prefer *, so, we need a function to convert any - bullet points to * bullet points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the change_bullet_style function. It takes a document (a string) as input, and returns a single string as output. The returned string should have any lines that start with a - character replaced with a * character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this:\n",
    "\n",
