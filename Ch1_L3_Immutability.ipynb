    "# Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "In FP, we strive to make data immutable. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Mutable data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.\n",
    "Who Cares?\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable data is easier to think about and work with. When 10 different functions have access to the same variable, and you're debugging a problem with that variable, you have to consider the possibility that any of those functions could have changed the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable is immutable, you can be sure that it hasn't changed since it was created. It's a helluva lot easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, immutability means fewer bugs and more maintainable code.\n",
