    "# Sum Types\n",

    "Remember when I said, \"Pure functions are my favorite part of functional programming\"? Well, [sum types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) are a close second.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"sum\" type is the opposite of a \"product\" type. This Python object is an example of a _product_ type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "man.studies_finance = True\n",
    "man.has_trust_fund = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of combinations a `man` can have is `4`, the _product_ of `2 * 2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "|studies_finance|has_trust_fund|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|True|True|\n",
    "|True|False|\n",
    "|False|True|\n",
    "|False|False|\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add a third attribute, perhaps a `has_blue_eyes` boolean, the total number of possibilities multiplies again, to `8`!\n",
    "\n",
    "|studies_finance|has_trust_fund|has_blue_eyes|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|True|True|True|\n",

    "|False|False|False|\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's pretend that we live in a world where there are _really_ only [three types of people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEt0IuQJX2o) that our program cares about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dateable\n",
    "2. Undateable\n",
    "3. Maybe dateable\n",
    "\n",
    "We can _reduce_ the number of cases our code needs to handle by using a (admittedly fake Pythonic) sum type with only 3 possible _types_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Undateable(Person):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use the [isinstance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) built-in function to check if a `Person` is an instance of one of the subclasses. It's a clunky way to represent sum types, but hey, it's Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def respond_to_text(guy_at_bar):\n",
    "    if isinstance(guy_at_bar, Dateable):\n",

    "\n",
    "## Sum Types\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to product types, which can have many (often infinite) combinations, sum types have a _fixed_ number of possible values. To be clear: **Python doesn't really support sum types**. We have to use a workaround and invent our own little system and enforce it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a document is parsed by Doc2Doc, it can either succeed or fail. In functional programming, we often represent errors as data (e.g. the `ParseError` class) rather than by `raise`ing exceptions, because exceptions are side effects. _(This isn't standard Python practice, but it's useful to understand from an FP perspective)_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete the `Parsed` and `ParseError` subclasses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Parsed` represents success. It should accept a `doc_name` string and a `text` string and save them as properties of the same name.\n",
    "- `ParseError` represents failure. It should accept a `doc_name` string and an `err` string and save them as properties of the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test suite uses the `isinstance` function to see if an error occurred based on the class type."
